## Technologies Used
- Java: The primary programming language for the automation framework.
- Selenium WebDriver : For browser automation and interacting with web applications.
- TestNG: For test configuration, execution, and reporting.
- Cucumber: For Behavior Driven Development (BDD) testing.
- Jenkins: For Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
- Maven: For dependency management and build automation.
- GitHub: For version control and collaboration.
- Extent Reports: For detailed test execution reports.

## Features

- Page Object Model (POM) Design Pattern: Each web page is represented by a class (Page Object), which abstracts the page's elements and actions.
- Scalability: The framework is designed to be scalable for future enhancements and additional test cases. New tests and pages can be easily added.
- Extendability: New tests and features can be easily added without impacting existing functionality.
- Maintainability: The project structure and code are modular, making it easy to maintain and update.
- Cross-Browser Testing: Supports testing across multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
- BDD Support: Uses Cucumber for behavior-driven testing with readable Gherkin syntax.
- Parallel Test Execution: Runs tests in parallel to reduce execution time.
- CI/CD Integration: Fully integrated with Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment.
- Test Reporting: Customizable reporting via Extent Reports.
